My wallet is a brown leather flip wallet. There are a few outside pockets on each side. When you flip it open, there is a clear pocket on one side as well as a compartment to put your cards in. To get your cards out, there is a little button you press down on and the cards raise up so you can easily grab them.
My wallet is another very important item I always have on me. It contains my ways of payment including debit and credit cardds, I almost never carry cash. It has my drivers license in it so that I can drive my car and keep that identification on me. It has my helath insurance card for if I need to go to the doctors office or some other professional place where I would need it. Lastly, it also has all my gift cards to different places to eat or shop, I never want to be caught at a restraunt that I have a gift card for without the gift card, that just a waste of free money!
