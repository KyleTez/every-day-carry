# My **Keys**
<img class="about" alt="keys" src="/images/keys.jpeg" width="700" />
My keys are stored on a green and white MSU lanyard. They are an assortment of keys for different items as well as a few miscellaneous items.
My keys are the #1 thing I always make sure I have on my person when I'm leaving the house for a few reasons. The first is that my keys lanyard also has the keys to my apartment on them, if I were to accidentaly leave my apartment without my keys I would need to call my landlord to let me back in. The lanyard also has my car keys on it, I don't live super far from campus but if I need to travel anywhere further, I need to take my car, forget the lanyard and I can't really go anywhere. Lastly, my keys have a bunch of memorablia and little items on it that are personal to me, I like to keep them on me at all times.
