# My **Phone**
<img class="about" alt="keys" src="/images/keys.jpeg" width="700" />
My phone is an Iphone 15 with a black case, the glass screen protector is currently cracked.
I never leave my house without my phone. I use my phone constantly throughout the day whether that be for checking classes, texting, calling, checking email, playing games, using google maps because I'm lost, checking the time, anything. It's not exactly that I wouldn't survive without having my phone on me, more so that my phone makes life so much easier. I think that if I ever left my phone at home and I missed a call from my parents or girlfriend they would grow concerned that I might be in danger. I also like to stay caught up on news and emerging events, my phone lets me access different apps to stay caught up on these different things throughout the day.
